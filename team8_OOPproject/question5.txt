Two movers are putting heavy boxes into their truck. The boxes are the same shape and size. Each mover lifts one box up into the truck at a time. The movers lift the boxes at the same speed. Which box is lifted with a larger force?//A force is a push or a pull. A force can change an object's motion. It can make an object start to move. Or it can stop the motion of a moving object. A force can also make an object speed up or slow down. Forces can be different sizes. An object with more mass will need a larger force to change its motion.//Look for the box that is heavier. A box holding 48 pounds is heavier than a box holding 35 pounds. So, the box holding 48 pounds needs a larger force to start moving upward at the same speed as the other box.//a box holding 48 pounds//a box holding 35 pounds// //a box holding 48 pounds
A car is stuck in the snow. Together, three people apply a force to the back of the car to move it forward.//A force is a push or a pull that one object applies to a second object.
The direction of a push is away from the object that is pushing. The direction of a pull is toward the object that is pulling.//Together, people apply a force to the back of the car to move it forward. The direction of this force is away from the people. This force is a push.//Push//Pull// //Push
When a diver flips off of a platform, the force of Earth's gravity pulls him downward into the pool. What is the direction of this pull?//A force is a push or a pull that one object applies to another. Every force has a direction. The direction of a push is away from the object that is pushing. The direction of a pull is toward the object that is pulling.//The force of Earth's gravity pulls the diver downward. The direction of the pull is toward the center of Earth.//away from the center of Earth.//toward the center of Earth.// //away from the center of Earth.
Joseph wants to test homemade go-karts before a big race. The go-karts are all the same. He gives each of his friends a ride in a go-kart. He pushes each go-kart to make it start rolling at the beginning of each ride. Joseph makes sure that all of his friends get to ride at the same speed. What size force is needed to start each go-kart? Order the objects from largest force to smallest force.//A force is a push or a pull. A force can change an object's motion. It can make an object start to move. Or it can stop the motion of a moving object. A force can also make an object speed up or slow down. Forces can be different sizes. An object with more mass will need a larger force to change its motion.//Order the objects. The delivery that weighs 245 kilograms has the most mass. So, it will need the largest force to stop moving. Place this tile on the top. The delivery that weighs 205 kilograms has the second most mass. So, it will need the second largest force to stop moving. Place this tile next. The delivery that weighs 180 kilograms has the third most mass. So, it will need the third largest force to stop moving. Place this tile next.
The delivery that weighs 165 kilograms has the least mass. So, it will need the smallest force to stop moving. Place this tile on the bottom.//a go-kart carrying a friend with a mass of 17 kilograms//a go-kart carrying a friend with a mass of 19 kilograms//a go-kart carrying a friend with a mass of 16 kilograms//a go-kart carrying a friend with a mass of 21 kilograms
Ken is using a slingshot to launch stones into a lake. Ken launches each stone at the same speed. Order the colors of the stones to show the size of the force Ken needs to use to overcome each stone's inertia.//A force is a push or a pull. It can change the way an object is moving. A force can make an object start moving, stop moving, speed up, slow down, or change direction. An object continues moving the same way unless a force acts on it. This property is called inertia. One example is an object moving forward. It continues moving forward at the same speed unless a force acts on it. Another example is an object that is not moving. It stays still unless a force acts on it. An object's inertia depends on its mass. Think about pushing two objects with different masses. If you want them to speed up the same amount, you need to use a larger force to push the object with more mass. This is because the object with more mass has more inertia.//Use the data table to find the mass of each stone. Ken launches each stone at the same speed. He needs to use the largest force to overcome the inertia of the stone with the most mass. Place the colors of the stones in order from most mass to least mass: speckled, black, white, brown.//Black//Brown//Speckled//White
