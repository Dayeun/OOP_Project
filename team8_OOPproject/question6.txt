Two magnets are placed as shown. Will these magnets attract or repel each other? Hint: Magnets that attract pull together. Magnets that repel push apart.//Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. Whether a magnet attracts or repels other magnets depends on the positions of its poles, or ends. Every magnet has two poles, called north and south. Here are some examples of magnets. The north pole of each magnet is marked N, and the south pole is marked S. If different poles are closest to each other, the magnets attract. The magnets in the pair below attract. If the same poles are closest to each other, the magnets repel. The magnets in both pairs below repel.//Will these magnets attract or repel? To find out, look at which poles are closest to each other. The south pole of one magnet is closest to the south pole of the other magnet. Poles that are the same repel. So, these magnets will repel each other.//attract//repel// //repel
All matter is made of atoms. Atoms are very small pieces of matter. But they are not the smallest pieces of matter. Atoms are made of even smaller pieces, or particles. Some of these particles have a property called electric charge. There are two types of electric charge: positive and negative. Particles with a positive electric charge are called positive charges. Particles with a negative electric charge are called negative charges. Which of the following statements are true? Select all that apply.// //X Particles with any electric charge are called positive charges.
Particles with a positive electric charge are called positive charges. But particles with a negative electric charge are called negative charges.<br>X The smallest piece of matter is called an atom. Atoms are very small, but they are not the smallest pieces of matter. Atoms are made up of even smaller pieces, or particles, of matter.<br>O Electric charge can be positive or negative.

Two magnets are placed as shown. Will these magnets attract or repel each other?//Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.//To predict if these magnets will attract or repel, look at which poles are closest to each other.<br>The north pole of horseshoe magnet is closest to the south pole of bar magnet.<br>The south pole of horseshoe magnet is closest to the north pole of bar magnet.<br>Opposite poles attract. So, these magnets will attract each other.//attract//repel// //attract
The images below show two pairs fo magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different sizes and shapes.<br>Think about the magnetic force between the magnets in each pair. Which of the following statements is true?//Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces. The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other. You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by using magnets of different sizes. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller when the magnets are smaller.//The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1.//The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2.//The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.//The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2.
Atoms are so small that they cannot be seen without a special microscope. The positive charges and negative charges in atoms are even smaller!<br>To show charges, scientists often use models. A model is a tool used to make things in real life easier to understand. Models can show things in nature or things made by people. This drawing is a model of the charges a balloon has. It shows positive charges as +, or plus, signs. It shows negative charges as –, or minus, signs. This model shows which types of charges the balloon has. It also shows which type of charges the balloon has more of. But this model does not show all of the balloon's charges. A real balloon has many more charges than you can count. This is because real objects have many atoms. Just one grain of sand may have more than 10,000,000,000,000,000,000 atoms! And each atom has positive and negative charges.<br>What does this model show? Select all that apply.// //(O) This model shows that the balloon has both positive and negative charges. This model shows positive charges as + signs and negative charges as – signs. Both + and – signs are shown on this balloon.<br>(X) This model shows the real size and shape of the balloon's charges. Real charges are very small. They are much smaller than the charges shown in this model. Real charges are not shaped like + and – signs, either. The + and – signs are just pictures that show charges in this model.<br>(X) This model shows all of the balloon's charges. Just one grain of sand may have more than 10,000,000,000,000,000,000 charges. A real balloon would also have many charges, many more charges than this model shows.//This model shows that the balloon has both positive and negative charges.//This model shows the real size and shape of the balloon's charges.//This model shows all of the balloon's charges.//This model shows that the balloon has both positive and negative charges.
