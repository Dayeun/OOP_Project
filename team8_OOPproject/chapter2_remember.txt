A force is a push or a pull. A force can change an object's motion. It can make an object start to move. Or it can stop the motion of a moving object. A force can also make an object speed up or slow down. Forces can be different sizes. An object with more mass will need a larger force to change its motion.//
A force is a push or a pull that one object applies to a second object. The direction of a push is away from the object that is pushing. The direction of a pull is toward the object that is pulling.//
A force is a push or a pull that one object applies to another. Every force has a direction. The direction of a push is away from the object that is pushing. The direction of a pull is toward the object that is pulling.//

A force is a push or a pull. It can change the way an object is moving. A force can make an object start moving, stop moving, speed up, slow down, or change direction. An object continues moving the same way unless a force acts on it. This property is called inertia. One example is an object moving forward. It continues moving forward at the same speed unless a force acts on it. Another example is an object that is not moving. It stays still unless a force acts on it. An object's inertia depends on its mass. Think about pushing two objects with different masses. If you want them to speed up the same amount, you need to use a larger force to push the object with more mass. This is because the object with more mass has more inertia.//
